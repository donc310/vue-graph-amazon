Randy tells the whole story--design and development, racing and competition, engineering and technology, style and culture. All the iconic 911 models are included: the original 901 prototype that set the standard; the legendary RS models that made the little Porsche a dominant force on the world's racetracks; the infamous Turbo, the car that kept the performance flame alight during the dark, dismal decade of the 1970s; the fabled 959, the model that redefined the term \"sports car\"; the 993, last of the original air-cooled models; and the 996, 997, and 991, the liquid-cooled cars that brought the 911 into a new millennium. Beyond telling the story of the cars, <I>Porsche 911: 50 years</I> also spotlights the people behind them: Ferdinand \"Butzi\" Porsche, the son of legendary Porsche founder Ferdinand \"Ferry\" Porsche, who co-designed the instantly recognizable 911 shape; Peter W. Schutz, the Porsche CEO who saved the 911 from extinction; and Dr. Helmuth Bott, the engineering genius behind many of the groundbreaking technologies that have defined the 911, including fuel injection, turbocharging, and all-wheel-drive. Leffingwell also tells the story of the 911 community--the clubs and culture that surround the car. Together, all of these facets make <I>Porsche 911: 50 Years</I> the most essential book in any Porsche owner or fan's library.</P></DIV>"}],"attributes":{"Author":"Randy Leffingwell","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Motorbooks International","EAN":"9780760344019","EANList":{"EANListElement":["8601404311789","9780760344019","0752748344013","8601300470900"]},"Edition":"First Edition, First","Feature":"a 50-year retrospective of one of the world's premier sports cars, the Porsche.","ISBN":"0760344019","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"1225","Length":"1025","Weight":"443","Width":"100"},"Label":"Motorbooks","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"5000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$50.00"},"Manufacturer":"Motorbooks","MPN":"AB3712","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"256","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"102","Length":"1220","Weight":"428","Width":"1000"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"AB3712","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2013-10-20","Publisher":"Motorbooks","ReleaseDate":"2013-10-20","Studio":"Motorbooks","Title":"Porsche 911: 50 Years","TradeInValue":{"Amount":"1161","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$11.61"},"UPC":"752748344013","UPCList":{"UPCListElement":"752748344013"}},"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0760344019&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2019-10-10T07%3A38%3A07Z&v=2&sig=zLULIK%252BbMEwUmtKmVwwWVW2z5sjJJjC%252BCgnKRYX%252FDlM%253D","salesRank":64326,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31By9JkynaL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"131"},"url":"https://www.amazon.com/Porsche-911-Years-Randy-Leffingwell/dp/0760344019?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0760344019","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Porsche-911-Years-Randy-Leffingwell/dp/0760344019?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0760344019"},"related":["0760347255","0760365032","3740800356","B0033BXWQC","0837613310","3832733876","3961711518","3899556879","B007I8Q3M6","0760351902"]},{"id":"3740800356","thumbnail":{"width":"160","height":"118"},"title":"111 Porsche Stories You Should Know","info":{"price":{"amount":2281,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$22.81"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZsREH6hLL.jpg","Height":"370","Width":"500"},"descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<ul><li>111 Porsche stories that will give you a greater insight into the lengendary car manufactory</li><li>A must for anyone with even just a passing interest in Porsche</li></ul><p>What came first - the Porsche or the Beetle?

Description","content":"<p><b>Porsche - Origin of the Species</b> is the latest Porsche heritage book by renowned automotive historian Karl Ludvigsen.</p><p>Within Jerry Seinfeld s renowned Porsche collection resides an unassuming yet extraordinary piece of Porsche history: Porsche Gmund coupe 356/2-040. Captured exclusively for this book in a series of evocative portraits by acclaimed automotive photographer Michael Furman, 040's unsullied originality conveys with startling immediacy the combination of artistry, innovation and determination that went into its improbable creation. This cornerstone of the Seinfeld collection serves as the inspiration for <b>Porsche - Origin of the Species</b>, an in-depth exploration by the eminent automotive historian Karl Ludvigsen into the specific influences and circumstances that brought forth the first Porsche-badged sports cars.</p><p>How and when did the people of the Porsche firm find themselves in a sawmill in Gmund? What was the influence on the 356 of the cars and engines built by Porsche before and during the war? How and why was the first 356 shaped as it was? What was the real relationship between the tube-framed Type 356 roadster and the first 356/2 coupes? Questions like these deserve answers because the resulting DNA is so powerful, so robust, that it still influences the shape and style of Porsches well into the twenty-first century.</p><p>Karl Ludvigsen, author of the award-winning <b>Porsche: Excellence Was Expected</b> and <b>Ferdinand Porsche Genesis of Genius</b>, tackles these questions and more in <b>Porsche - Origin of the Species</b>. The saga that emerges encompasses mechanical revelations, human drama and the turmoil of world war. <b>Porsche - Origin of the Species</b> will appeal to all car enthusiasts who are eager to know what events really ignited the spark from which all other Porsches evolved. </p>"}],"attributes":{"Author":["Karl Ludvigsen","Jerry Seinfeld"],"Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9780837613314","EANList":{"EANListElement":["9780837613314","8601406722422"]},"ISBN":"0837613310","IsEligibleForTradeIn":"1","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"1080","Length":"1080","Weight":"545","Width":"160"},"Label":"Bentley Publishers","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"14995","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$149.95"},"Manufacturer":"Bentley Publishers","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"356","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"150","Length":"1100","Weight":"490","Width":"1100"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2012-09-03","Publisher":"Bentley Publishers","Studio":"Bentley Publishers","Title":"Porsche - Origin of the Species with Foreword by Jerry Seinfeld","TradeInValue":{"Amount":"5100","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$51.00"}},"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0837613310&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2019-10-10T07%3A38%3A07Z&v=2&sig=JtZY7DzCGa2xu9NBDjKCnsFM69W49z9orGkAx%252Bkgd6c%253D","salesRank":181073,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CANxfMiUL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"159","Width":"160"},"url":"https://www.amazon.com/Porsche-Origin-Species-Foreword-Seinfeld/dp/0837613310?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0837613310","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Porsche-Origin-Species-Foreword-Seinfeld/dp/0837613310?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0837613310"},"related":["0760347255","0760344019","0760365032","0760351902","3667113285","3961711674","3740800356","3961711518","3832733876","1785003208"]},{"id":"0142408255","thumbnail":{"width":"160","height":"160"},"title":"If I Built a Car","info":{"price":{"amount":748,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$7.48"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sacZvHniL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"500"},"descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"\"If I built a car, it'd be totally new!

The Porsche 911 inspires a worldwide ripple effect.<br /><br />When Ferdinand Porsche could not find a sports car he liked, he decided to build one himself. And now, the rest is history: Jerry Seinfeld drives it; Boris Johnson admires it; Steve McQueen loves it; and Jeremy Clarkson hates it. The Porsche 911 moves the world. Despised by many in Germany as a set of wheels for fat cats, it is the favorite car of free spirits and intellectuals in the U.S. and across the globe. The Porsche 911 was not just invented by one of the most fascinating and controversial families – it is also a technical meisterwerk. Since its launch in 1963, the 911 has built a reputation for itself as \"the thinking man’s sports car.\" Both a car and a cultural icon, it has earned a fan base that spans from young to old, East to West, connoisseur to enthusiast.<br /><br />Porsche 911: The Ultimate Sportscar as Cultural Icon explains how this German car became a global phenomenon and a symbol of aspiration, freedom, and the appetite for perfection, and even more, why, around the world, the 911 continues to fascinate gentlemen, ladies, and rogue drivers. In this book, Ulf Poschardt sends Porsche drivers to the shrink and concludes that a little narcissm can be a healthy thing; he then takes them on an engaging journey through the checkered history that defines their pride and joy. Not everyone can, nor indeed should, drive a Porsche, but Porsche 911: The Ultimate Sportscar as Cultural Icon lays bare the raw driving force behind the 911 for anyone intrepid enough to discover."}],"attributes":{"Author":"Ulf Poschardt","Binding":"Hardcover","Brand":"Gestalten","EAN":"9783899556872","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9783899556872"},"Feature":"Gestalten","IsAdultProduct":"0","IsAutographed":"0","ISBN":"3899556879","IsMemorabilia":"0","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"1056","Length":"869","Weight":"275","Width":"106"},"Label":"Gestalten","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"4000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$40.00"},"Manufacturer":"Gestalten","MPN":"1A_7618","NumberOfPages":"240","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"102","Length":"1039","Weight":"278","Width":"843"},"PackageQuantity":"1","PartNumber":"1A_7618","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-01-19","Publisher":"Gestalten","ReleaseDate":"2017-04-19","Studio":"Gestalten","Title":"Porsche 911: The Ultimate Sportscar as Cultural Icon"},"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=3899556879&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2019-10-10T08%3A54%3A51Z&v=2&sig=aeISPOlpsJNGtjZc009b4WSWtmQ3zaAlImvcSdoO6Eo%253D","salesRank":340042,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41s8Dpn4iML._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"121"},"url":"https://www.amazon.com/Porsche-911-Ultimate-Sportscar-Cultural/dp/3899556879?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=3899556879","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Porsche-911-Ultimate-Sportscar-Cultural/dp/3899556879?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=3899556879"},"related":["0760347255","0760344019","0760365032","3961711518","3740800356","0760351902","3667111134","396171021X","3832733876","0760352097"]},{"id":"3961711518","thumbnail":{"width":"134","height":"160"},"title":"The Porsche 911 Book","info":{"price":{"amount":7872,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$78.72"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4149oxTYa2L.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"418"},"descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"The introduction of the Porsche 901 in 1963 marked↵ <p/>a milestone in automotive history.

This train travels through history making stops in time to learn about the progress of travel by rail.<br><br>Hop up into the cab of a speeding modern-day locomotive and look down the tracks into the past. Perhaps these are the same tracks that the diesel-electric locomotives of thirty years ago thundered down, pulling their loads. Perhaps you can see the steam engines of thirty years before that. Watch time unravel and the landscape change as the history of trains barrels through the pages of STEAM, SMOKE AND STEEL: BACK IN TIME WITH TRAINS.<br><br>The first trains puffed great billowing clouds of smoke and showered passengers with burning embers as they sped down the rails at a pulse-pounding twenty miles an hour! By the 1850's, however, trains were traveling much faster, much farther, and much cleaner and train travel contributed to the growth of our nation. Young readers will be fascinated by the exciting -- and sometimes dangerous -- story of trains while they learn about the different kinds of engines, equipment, and jobs necessary for operating trains throughout history. The young narrator introduces readers to trains from the time of his great-great-great-great-great grandfather at the turn of the nineteenth century to his father's train of today, showing the great changes that invention and progress have brought over time.<br><br>Patrick O'Brien's striking illustrations emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and romance of the train. Detailed and richly textured oil paintings take readers on a trip through time to ride aboard open-air cars, travel through mountain passes, and roar down the rails on high-speed bullet trains. Budding engineers will love getting a glimpse at the past and dreaming about the future of trains."}],"attributes":{"Author":"Patrick O'Brien","Binding":"Paperback","Color":"Multicolor","Creator":"Patrick O'Brien","EAN":"9780881069723","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9780881069723"},"ISBN":"0881069728","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"1100","Length":"850","Weight":"35","Width":"12"},"Label":"Charlesbridge","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"795","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$7.95"},"Manufacturer":"Charlesbridge","ManufacturerMinimumAge":"120","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"32","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"20","Length":"1080","Weight":"30","Width":"830"},"PackageQuantity":"1","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2000-07-01","Publisher":"Charlesbridge","ReleaseDate":"2000-07-01","Studio":"Charlesbridge","Title":"Steam, Smoke, and Steel: Back in Time with Trains"},"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=0881069728&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2019-10-10T07%3A38%3A01Z&v=2&sig=k7Ie10wW%252BRak44t20vr9FppuuGWiC9Q2nL4uenSCfbQ%253D","salesRank":45154,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J5ESWm%2BzL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"124","Width":"160"},"url":"https://www.amazon.com/Steam-Smoke-Steel-Back-Trains/dp/0881069728?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0881069728","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Steam-Smoke-Steel-Back-Trains/dp/0881069728?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0881069728"},"related":["0448191113","146545361X","1416994157","0375869417","1426307772","0763663077","0756650321","0756614600","0312519435","0753461714"]},{"id":"146543187X","thumbnail":{"width":"124","height":"160"},"title":"DK Eyewitness Books: Universe: Marvel at the Beauty of the Universe from Our Solar System to Galaxies in the Fa","info":{"price":{"amount":999,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$9.99"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GEFk9MJgL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"386"},"descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"Whether your child has a special interest in space exploration or the origins of the universe, or you want to supplement classroom curriculum about the universe by making more resources available to your child outside of school, <i>Eyewitness: Universe</i> is the ideal choice for learning more about the universe. <p>DK's <i>Eyewitness</i> series is perfect for children.

It also shows exactly how to perform mechanical upkeep and repairs on the most common outdoor power implements, including lawn mowers, snow blowers, chain saws, power washers, generators, leaf blowers, rototillers, wood splitters, lawn edgers, and weed whips.

While many have fallen short of <I>Top Gear's</I> exacting standards, others have triumphed, proving so damn cool they're termed \"SubZero.\" This unique bible of motoring coolness recounts the stories behind history's greatest cars, from prewar vintage motors to the supercars of the future, pairing stunning <I>Top Gear</I> photography and rarely seen archive photographs with expert commentary. It breaks down the technology behind these incredible machines and places each car in the context of its time, with anecdotes and analysis that explain just what's so cool about each one. From the quintessential British luxury of the Bentley Brooklands to the Italian sex appeal of the Bizzarini Strada, the old Hollywood glamour of the Chrysler Airflow to the futuristic lines of the Aston Martin Bulldog via Steve McQueen's Ford Mustang and James Dean's doomed Porsche Spyder, this is social history as much as car worship.

However, the aura of Ferrari does indeed approach the miraculous. What lies behind this phenomenon? What is the source of fascination for a brand whose creative designs are internationally recognized and enthusiastically received? First, even today--70 years after the company was founded--the miracle of Ferrari is still due in large part to the personality of Il Commendatore, Enzo Ferrari. Patience, passion, and being hard on himself and those around him gave the brand, under the emblem of the Cavallino Rampante, the power to become what it is today: sheer fascination on four wheels. Second, the long list of international racing victories is equally important. There is no class, no competition, that Ferrari did not set its sights on and win more or less immediately during the company's last 70 years. Finally, Ferrari is synonymous with aesthetics, elegance, and trend-setting design. The true value of a brand and its products is measured in the currency of impassioned devotion. This is the third and perhaps most vital element confirming the Ferrari miracle: The Ferrari Book - Passion for Design traces the evolution of the miracle and lets us experience passion given automotive form in a large and engrossing format."}],"attributes":{"Author":"MICHAEL KÖCKRITZ","Binding":"Hardcover","EAN":"9783961710201","EANList":{"EANListElement":"9783961710201"},"Edition":"Multilingual","IsAutographed":"0","ISBN":"9783961710201","IsMemorabilia":"0","ItemDimensions":{"Height":"1500","Length":"1150","Weight":"1000","Width":"175"},"Label":"teNeues","Languages":{"Language":[{"Name":"English","Type":"Published"},{"Name":"German","Type":"Original Language"},{"Name":"German","Type":"Unknown"},{"Name":"English","Type":"Unknown"},{"Name":"French","Type":"Unknown"},{"Name":"Italian","Type":"Unknown"}]},"ListPrice":{"Amount":"15000","CurrencyCode":"USD","FormattedPrice":"$150.00"},"Manufacturer":"teNeues","MPN":"29165986","NumberOfItems":"1","NumberOfPages":"416","PackageDimensions":{"Height":"150","Length":"1480","Weight":"1005","Width":"1180"},"PartNumber":"29165986","ProductGroup":"Book","ProductTypeName":"ABIS_BOOK","PublicationDate":"2017-11-15","Publisher":"teNeues","ReleaseDate":"2017-11-15","Studio":"teNeues","Title":"The Ferrari Book: Passion for Design"},"reviews":"https://www.amazon.com/reviews/iframe?akid=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&alinkCode=xm2&asin=3961710201&atag=wwwyasivcom-20&exp=2019-10-10T07%3A37%3A58Z&v=2&sig=1gLDEkOnMAC9cpJKj10c3z9rtBG6zJMGp4KaA1IkZN0%253D","salesRank":69646,"icon":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Wyvcwd3YL._SL160_.jpg","Height":"160","Width":"134"},"url":"https://www.amazon.com/Ferrari-Book-Passion-Design/dp/3961710201?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=3961710201","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Ferrari-Book-Passion-Design/dp/3961710201?SubscriptionId=AKIAIJKR6IY4BV5FKK7A&tag=wwwyasivcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=3961710201"},"related":["0760351899","1935007289","3832798587","0760347255","396171018X","0760347956","071487518X","3961711062","1419708635","3832769188"]},{"id":"146543805X","thumbnail":{"width":"126","height":"160"},"title":"Cars, Trains, Ships, and Planes: A Visual Encyclopedia of Every Vehicle","info":{"price":{"amount":1789,"hidden":false,"currency":"USD","formatted":"$17.89"},"image":{"URL":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XonRbWLlL.jpg","Height":"500","Width":"394"},"descriptions":[{"title":"Product Description","content":"<p>Get kids revved up and ready to read.</p><p><i>Cars, Trains, Ships & Planes</i> is a visual encyclopedia of every vehicle to zoom, sail, soar, float, or fly across the land, sea, and sky.

This series builds essential literacy skills including phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, and comprehension. Primary Phonics is comprised of 5 sets of storybooks, coordinating workbooks, reference books, teacher s manuals, and an audio story CD for students in grades K-2. The extension More Primary Phonics allows for additional practice with two more sets of storybooks and workbook exercises.Primary Phonics also includes a comprehension component called Thinking about Mac and Tab. The comprehension workbooks follow the same phonetic patterns as the coordinating workbooks and storybooks. The 147 wh- 148 question words (who, what, why, etc.) are introduced as sight words, as students independently work through the series. Students learn to sequence, recognize story elements, use context clues, and refer to storybook pages, among other skills. Each workbook corresponds to a set of Primary Phonics storybooks 1-5. Primary Phonics Workbook 1 reviews the 17 consonants covered in the Consonant Book and then introduces short vowels in two- and three-letter words. Using a patterned series of exercises, it also introduces the sight words is, a, the, on, in, yes, no, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and black. Exercises involve simple yes or no questions, coloring, copying words below illustrations, filling in missing words in short sentences, and unscrambling words.Storybooks Set 1 reinforces and provides practice with the skills taught in Workbook 1.
