Here's a few advantages of owning our sign #1 Highly VISIBLE and Promotes AWARENESS The background of the sign is a deep bright yellow color while showcasing the words \"Baby on Board\" in bold black, creating the perfect safety sign, visible to all nearby drivers. #2 Top Range DESIGN Our sign is specifically tailored for purpose. We don't use suction cups which are known to lose suction and fall off. We don't use magnets which can damage paint works. Our sign is applied to the outside of the window. Most 'Baby on Board' signs are applied to the inside of the window reducing visibility of the sign itself. #3 SEE-THROUGH The sticker is designed to be see-through from the back so that while you are reversing your car you can still see-thru the sign when looking in the rearview mirror ensuring visibility is not obscured. #4 Easy To Use Clean the surface of dust, ensuring maximum stick. Then simply peel off the sticker and can apply it to the outside of the car. #5 Tint FRIENDLY Have tinted windows on your car? our sign is applied to the outside of the vehicle to provide maximum visibility. #6 DURABLE The sticker consists of a strong adhesive and is resistant to all the weather's elements such as rain and heat. They are also UV protected keeping the suns rays at bay. The sign will also make a lovely gift for anybody who has welcomed a new addition to their family!

            "✅ SEE-THROUGH & HIGHLY VISIBLE: As Always Parents, SAFETY 1st! Our conventional baby on board stickers are bright yellow making them highly visible but, better yet they are also SEE-THROUGH from the inside of the car making reversing and looking in your rear view mirror safe and easy, without obscuring your view.",
            "✅ GUARANTEED TO STAY ON: The Sign uses strong adhesive to ensure it won't peel off your car window and it's built to endure all weather conditions, from the summer heat to the winter snow! Since it is applied on the outside of the car it can be used with TINTED WINDOWS unlike signs with suction cups which also lose suction and lack longevity while magnetic signs risk damage to paint work. Our sign is the perfect sign!",
            "✅ EASE OF USE AND LOW MAINTENANCE: Firstly, clean down the area of glass were the sign will be applied to ensure it is free from dust. Then peel the sticker label off and apply it firmly. It's that simple! Once applied no more maintenance is required. For maximum effectiveness it's best to apply the sign to the back window or both of the side windows.",
